Known issues (9/18)
- Wavemaker:  the location of the wavemaker is not correct, leading to a strange, non-phyiscal animation particuarly when the water depth is increased
- Seiche Calculator: sometimes does not appear on mobile devices
- Streamfunction: just doesnt work.  Its a complex one - will take some time to work on it, or wait for a better LLM to handle to more challenging code
- Tides: the visualization of the "Single" component is not correct.  Also, it would be good to add axis labels.
