This is the source code for Dalrymple's Coastal Engineering Java applets.
To install, untar in the final desired directory:
   tar -xvf javapp.tar

There is a makefile that can be used to compile the source code (*.java) into
byte code (*.class).  If you have the java compiler (javac) in /usr/local/java/bin
then you need only type 'make' in the directory you untarred the source files.  If
javac is elsewhere, edit Makefile appropriately.

By using Netscape's open file command pointed at index.html in this directory,
you should have access to all the applets.

Good luck and send me feedback.
