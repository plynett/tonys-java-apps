The deposition of sand on the updrift side of  a groin and the subsequent (and antisymmetric) erosion of sand on the downdrift side of a groin can be determined analytically from a one-line contour model.
<p>
The magenta region is the shoreline viewed from above. The vertical black line denotes the groin and the horizontal black line in the center is the original shoreline position.  <p>
The variable <I> width</I>  denotes the width of the figure, and <I>time</I> indicates the elapsed time in days.  The <I>Q</I> shows the area accreted (or eroded) with time.  To determine the impounded sand volume, multiply this amount by (B+h*), where B is the berm height of the beach and h* is the depth of closure. Finally, <I>xm</I> is the distance from the groin to a location where the shoreline displacement (at bypassing) is one hundredth the length of the groin.  This is a measure of the alongshore influence of the groin.
<p>
The animation stops when the groin begins to bypass sand.
